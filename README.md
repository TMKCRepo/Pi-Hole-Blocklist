# Pi-Hole-Blocklist

This is my blocklist made for PiHole.
I basically copied the pre-provided list from "StevenBlack" and added my own blocks to it.
If you want to look at the default list, you can look here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts

This repo is updated regularly. Feel free to add this to your PiHole blocklist.
I am trying to add in as many "ad links" as I can when I find them. If you find any links, please make a Pull Request and I will add it in to the list.
